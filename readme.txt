== Integration with Other Plugins ==

= Twilio SMS Plugin Fix =

If you're using a Twilio plugin that sends SMS notifications on order creation instead of payment completion, you can fix this by modifying the plugin to use our proper hooks:

**Before (sends on order creation):**
`add_action('woocommerce_new_order', 'send_twilio_sms');`

**After (sends only on payment completion):**
`add_action('best_woo_alerts_payment_completed', 'send_twilio_sms_on_payment', 10, 4);`

See the **Integration Guide** in the plugin files for detailed instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with WooCommerce HPOS? =
Yes! The plugin automatically detects whether you're using High Performance Order Storage and updates the correct database tables.

= Can I use custom alert sounds? =
